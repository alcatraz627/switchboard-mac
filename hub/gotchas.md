## 2026-05-07 — README hero must be a file, not inline `<svg>`

GitHub.com renders inline `<svg>` blocks in `README.md` correctly, so it's tempting
to paste raw SVG markup directly into the README. But almost every other markdown
renderer (Cursor/VS Code preview, terminal viewers like glow/mdcat, Claude
Desktop's reader, npm/crates.io project pages, AI assistants reading the file) strips
the SVG element and dumps the inner `<text>` nodes as plain prose — producing an
unreadable wall of words like "Claude Instances Native macOS menu bar... opus
sonnet haiku RUNNING SESSIONS opus 14t · 482 t/s..." right at the top of the page.

**Fix:** Always write SVG to a file under `assets/` and reference via
`<img src="assets/banner.svg" width="...">`. The banner and UI-preview SVGs in
this repo live at `assets/banner.svg` and `assets/preview.svg` for that reason.
Same rule applies to any future hero/diagram art added to the README.

## 2026-05-08 — `const` in JS halts the script if hit before its declaration

In `lib/detail.sh`'s embedded JS, the flow-arrow code defined `const FLOW_ICONS`
and `function rebuildFlowArrows()` AFTER `applyFilter()` was first called.
Function declarations are fully hoisted, so the call was syntactically valid —
but `const FLOW_ICONS` is in temporal dead zone until its declaration line is
reached. Calling `rebuildFlowArrows()` early threw `ReferenceError: Cannot
access 'FLOW_ICONS' before initialization`, which propagated up and **halted
the entire `<script>` block**. Net effect: not just no flow arrows — every JS
feature added after that point silently stopped working too. No console error
visible without devtools open.

**Fix:** Place every `const` referenced by a hoisted function declaration
BEFORE any code that calls that function. Or move both the const + the
function above any call sites.

**Process lesson:** A static `rg -c flow-arrow` confirms strings are *in the
file* but says nothing about whether DOM elements ever got created. Always
open generated HTML pages in a browser via `chrome-devtools-mcp` and run
`evaluate_script` to confirm runtime state matches expectation. Two passes
of "looks right in the source" claimed flow arrows worked when they didn't.

## 2026-05-08 — NSMenu items don't auto-refresh while the menu is open

AppKit calls `menuNeedsUpdate(_:)` when the menu is *about to open*, not while
it's visible. Our scan timer keeps `cachedData` fresh in the background, but
the on-screen rows render off the snapshot taken at open time and stay frozen
until the user closes + reopens.

**Fix (parked):** Convert per-instance rows to view-based `NSMenuItem.view`
items so each row owns its own NSTextField/labels and can mutate them in
place when data changes. See `UPGRADE-PLAN.md` "PARKED — Live-update while
menu is open" for decomposition.

**Workaround today:** The Refresh submenu's "Refresh Now" + close/reopen is
the manual path. Cadence picker keeps the background data fresh.

## 2026-05-08 — Chrome blocks `fetch()` between two `file://` URLs

Since Chrome 67 (2018), every `file://` URL is treated as its own opaque
origin. A `file://` page CANNOT `fetch()` another `file://` URL — same-
directory or otherwise. This blocks the natural "transcript page polls its
own file for fresh content" pattern.

**Fix (parked):** Spawn a tiny localhost `http.server` in detail.sh and open
the browser via `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/...`. fetch() then works normally.
See `UPGRADE-PLAN.md` "PARKED — Live-update while transcript is open".

**Workaround today:** Background daemon regenerates the file every 5 minutes;
manual ↻ Refresh button does `location.reload()` to pick up the latest.

---

## 2026-05-08 — `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` + heavy JS = visible flicker

The transcript page used `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5">` to keep
itself current. Worked fine when the page was static HTML + minimal JS. After
adding `marked.js` + `highlight.js` via CDN, every 5s reload re-fetched (cache
hit) AND **re-parsed AND re-executed** both libraries, then `marked.parse()`
ran on every message, then `hljs.highlightElement()` ran on every code block —
all on a freshly-torn-down DOM. Result: ~50–100ms work per tick, visible as
a flash + content reflow.

**Fix:** Remove meta-refresh entirely. Use a background regenerator daemon
to keep the file fresh on disk; user clicks a manual ↻ Refresh button to
do a single intentional `location.reload()`. Live-without-click needs the
HTTP-server approach above.

**General principle:** Don't reload a document if you don't have to. The
moment your page has expensive client-side work (markdown rendering, syntax
highlighting, image processing), full reload is no longer cheap.

## 2026-05-08 — Background subshells need `BASHPID` for self-identification

The transcript regenerator daemon writes its own PID to a lock file so
subsequent invocations can dedupe. Two pitfalls:

1. **`disown <pid>` usually doesn't work** — `disown` expects a job spec
   like `%1`, not a numeric PID. The variant `disown` (no args) targets the
   most-recent backgrounded job and is what you usually want.
2. **`$$` inside a `(...)` subshell returns the parent shell's PID, not the
   subshell's.** Use `$BASHPID` to get the subshell's actual PID. Without
   this, our daemon was writing the parent's PID to the lock file, then the
   parent exited and `kill -0 <pid>` failed even though the daemon was alive.

**Fix:** `DAEMON_SELF_PID=$BASHPID` inside the subshell, and gate the
self-cleanup `rm -f "$DAEMON_PID_FILE"` on a content match check so a NEW
daemon's PID write isn't trampled by an OLD daemon's exit cleanup.

## 2026-05-11 — Don't ship "placeholder" settings without wiring

Shipped a Menu Behavior section with three controls (density / default tab
/ time format) that persisted to UserDefaults but **had no reader on the
bar side**. The UI implied functionality that didn't exist. User caught
it immediately: "Wow you added new settings but did not wire them."

**Fix shipped:** every UserDefaults key now has a corresponding accessor
function (`densitySpacing()`, `userTimeFormatter()`) called by the actual
render path, plus a `.menuBehaviorDidChange` notification so the bar
re-renders when the user changes a value.

**Process rule, going forward:** if a Settings UI exposes a control,
that control's reader sites must exist before the commit lands. Two
acceptable shapes:

1. **Functional from day one** — the bar reads the value at the relevant
   call site. This is the only shipping configuration.
2. **Explicitly marked "experimental / not wired yet"** — a visible
   "(not yet active)" label on the control AND a commit message that
   says exactly what's missing. Only do this when the wiring requires
   significantly more work than the UI.

Implicit "I'll wire it later" is not an option. The user can't tell from
the UI which controls do anything; their reasonable assumption is that
all of them do.

**Test added:** `tests/run-tests.sh` now greps for the reader call sites
(`stack.spacing = densitySpacing()`, `userTimeFormatter`, etc.) so a
future regression that disconnects the UI from the reader will fail the
suite.

## 2026-05-09 — `NSMenuItem.attributedTitle` doesn't redraw an open item

Discovered while implementing live-menu updates: AppKit reads
`menuItem.attributedTitle` once when the menu opens (in
`menuNeedsUpdate(_:)`), then freezes the rendered text until the menu
closes. Mutating attributedTitle from a Timer or background callback
while the menu is visible has no visible effect — the value updates in
the model, but the user sees stale text.

**Fix:** view-based menu items. `NSMenuItem.view = customNSView` lets you
control the rendering yourself; the view can mutate its labels in place
while the menu is open and AppKit redraws normally. Hover/click/submenu
semantics are preserved — view-based items behave like standard ones for
those interactions, just with custom rendering.

The trade-off: a view-based item costs more code (lay out an NSStackView
of NSTextFields, manage Auto Layout, handle add/remove on data changes)
but it's the only way to get a "live" menu in AppKit. Don't waste time
trying to make attributedTitle work — it won't.

See `LiveRowView` in `native/claude-instances-bar.swift` for the pattern.

## 2026-05-09 — `nohup` + `disown` is the only way to truly detach a bg process

Spawning the detail-server.py needed to outlive its parent `bash detail.sh`
(which exits after opening the browser). Two layers of detachment needed:

1. `nohup python3 ... &` — ignores SIGHUP so the process survives parent exit
2. `disown` — removes from the shell's job table so the parent doesn't wait
   on it during shutdown

Skipping either: `nohup` alone leaves the job in the parent's job table
which can keep the parent shell alive in some environments. `disown` alone
sends SIGHUP to the child when the parent exits.

Note also `disown` (no args) targets the most recent backgrounded job —
the form `disown <pid>` is unreliable because `disown` wants %job not PID,
and silently fails on PID arguments. Just use bare `disown`.

## 2026-05-09 — file:// → file:// fetch is blocked, http://localhost works

(Same root cause as the earlier Chrome `file://` CORS gotcha, recorded
again because the FIX is now committed and worth pointing to.)

The fix shipped: spawn a tiny `python3 -m http.server`-style backend on
`127.0.0.1:<per-pid-port>` and open the browser at the http URL instead
of `file://`. Once both ends share the http://127.0.0.1 origin, fetch
works normally. Localhost is a "potentially trustworthy" origin so even
features that require secure context (Service Worker, Clipboard API,
crypto.subtle) work without HTTPS.

See `lib/detail-server.py` for the minimal implementation: subclasses
`SimpleHTTPRequestHandler`, adds a `/regen` endpoint, sets no-cache
headers on every response.
