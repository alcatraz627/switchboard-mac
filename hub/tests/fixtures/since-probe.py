"""Does the live tail deliver everything exactly once — and still go idle?

Failure modes covered, each a real incident or the audit's browser repro:
  1. the original bug — tools appended to an already-seen seq never arrive
  2. the naive fix — always resending the open group means records is never
     empty, so quietPolls never increments and the UI never says 'your turn'
  3. the renumber — a mid-file insert shifts every later seq, so a seq-keyed
     client renders the tools group twice and silently drops the genuinely-new
     record; identity must come from record ids, not positions
  4. the grow-and-close gap — a group that gains tools AND closes between two
     polls falls out of both the open-resend and the after-cursor buckets; the
     cursor must never park on an open group or that growth is lost forever

Simulates the real client loop (transcript-app.html pollLive/refreshOpen) and
the server slice (hub-server.py /data after_id) against a live-appended
fixture. Throwaway files under /tmp only.
