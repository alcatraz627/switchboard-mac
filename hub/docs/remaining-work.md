# Remaining work — dashboard truthfulness

Living doc. Written 2026-07-17 at the end of the audit that produced `b225076`.
Everything here is measured or reproduced, not inferred. Read the **Ground
truth** section before touching anything — it exists so you don't re-derive what
cost a whole session to learn.

## The principle these all serve

The owner's framing, verbatim, because it decides priority better than severity
labels do:

> "When the whole transcripts page blows up, it feels like an error one can fix,
> an understandable aspect of writing software. But when the small logical bugs
> cause the system to behave in a self-inconsistent or contradictory or
> reality-divergent way, that's when it truly feels broken, and it breaks trust
> more than an outright error."

So: a number that is confidently wrong outranks a crash. R1 below is a *display*
bug by conventional triage and the highest-value item here by this standard —
the header says "today: 19 sessions" when there are 148.

---

## Ground truth — do not re-derive these

**The tree.** `main`, unprotected. `b225076` (the audit) and `8d61a30` (an
earlier session's provider artifacts) are committed. As of writing, ~20 commits
were ahead of `origin/main` and the push was pending the owner's per-push
approval sentinel — check `git status -sb` rather than trusting this line.

**Tests.** `bash tests/run-tests.sh` → **5 failed / 248 passed** (2026-07-18).
The 5 are a pre-existing baseline: SPA greps for `const HUB =` /
`function diffBlock` in `transcript-app.html`; they fail on a clean checkout
too. **A 6th failure is yours.** The suite takes ~90s (it compiles Swift), so
run it in the background. History note: the long-standing 6th baseline
failure, `bar FAILED to compile`, was never a broken bar — the suite's compile
line was missing `SettingsWindowController.swift` (added to build.sh but not
the test). Fixed 2026-07-18; the bar is NOT frozen, `bash native/build.sh`
builds and redeploys it.

**Calling scan.sh's internals.** It is a bash wrapper around an embedded python
heredoc, so nothing is importable. Use the probe:

```bash
python3 tests/fixtures/scan-probe.py estimate opus 1000000 1000000   # -> 90.0
python3 tests/fixtures/scan-probe.py read_cost <pid>
python3 tests/fixtures/scan-probe.py tokens 'Infinity'               # -> 0
python3 tests/fixtures/scan-probe.py local_day '2026-07-16T19:00:00Z'
python3 tests/fixtures/scan-probe.py tail <file> <n>
python3 tests/fixtures/scan-probe.py read_pid_file <pid> <kind>
python3 tests/fixtures/scan-probe.py turns_big 40                    # -> 40:40:True
python3 tests/fixtures/scan-probe.py history_session 12              # -> 12:120:60
python3 tests/fixtures/scan-probe.py poison_scan                     # -> STRICT_JSON_OK
```
Its `load()` shows the exec trick if you need it directly. `since-probe.py`
drives the real client poll loop against a growing fixture.

**The hub.** Runs on `127.0.0.1:5400` from this tree. `scan.sh` re-runs per
request (2s cache) so scan edits are live with no restart — but `hub-server.py`
and `transcript.py` are imported into the process, so **those need
`bash lib/hub.sh restart`**. Always `python3 -c "import ast; ast.parse(...)"`
both before restarting a service the owner is looking at.

**Hard-won facts.** Each of these cost real time:

- `lsof` **ORs** its selection flags. `-p <pids> -d cwd` means "these pids OR
  any cwd" and dumps the whole process table — 2394 lines for a pid that does
  not exist. `-a` ANDs them. This is why `prime_process_info` passes `-a`.
- `os.path.exists()` returns **True** for a FIFO; only `os.path.isfile()` is
  False. Opening a FIFO with no writer blocks forever. The codebase's original
  `exists()` guard protected nothing — every per-PID read goes through
  `read_pid_file()` for exactly this reason.
- `json.loads` accepts a bare `Infinity`/`NaN`. A transcript is a file on disk,
  so usage counts are untrusted; `token_count()` is the boundary. An infinite
  cost serializes to a literal no JSON parser accepts and takes down every
  consumer of the scan, not one card.
- `parse_qs` drops blank values unless `keep_blank_values=True` — `?since=` read
  as "absent" and bypassed validation entirely.
- macOS has **no `timeout(1)`**, and a plain `perl alarm` orphans the child. Use
  the process-group kill (see the FIFO tests in `run-tests.sh`).
- `re.sub(r'[/.]', '-', cwd)` in scan.sh is **not a bug**. It mirrors Claude
  Code's own project-dir naming (`/Users/x/.claude` → `-Users-x--claude`,
  verified against 4 real dirs). "Fixing" it points the scanner at directories
  that do not exist. A reviewer will flag it; reject it.
- The scan's cost is **95% subprocess spawns**, not file reads. Profile before
  optimizing: the 26MB `readlines()` everyone blames was 17ms of 2835ms.
- `codex_transcript_iter` caps by **calendar shard date** (14 days), not file
  mtime — a codex session still being written inside a >14-day-old shard is
  invisible to the scan. Pre-existing on both sides of R1; flagged by the R1
  validation pass, left as-is.

**Never** run `git checkout` / `stash` / `reset` / `clean` to test a mutation —
restore by copy. **Never** write a real `/tmp/claude-{cost,tpath,statusline,ctx}-<pid>`
for a live pid; use fake pids in the 999xxx range. **Never** plant fixtures in
the real `~/.claude/projects` (a permission hook will stop you, but don't rely
on it).

## R1 — Aggregates cover 20 sessions and call it "today" — DONE 2026-07-17

Shipped on `feat/r1-truthful-aggregates`. The header now reports the real
window: today/week totals walk every provider session in the last 7 days
through a per-file summary cache at `~/.claude/widgets/.session-summaries.json`
keyed by `(mtime_ns, size)`, so unchanged transcripts never re-parse (warm
scan 1.5-1.7s == baseline; the one-time cold rebuild ~2.9s). The display list
stays capped at 20 — it is a list of rows, not a total.

Found on the way, both fixed:

- `claude_transcript_iter` recursed into `<sid>/subagents/`, so sub-agent
  transcripts counted as sessions (a week read 644 when 265 was true) with
  their tokens double-counted. Top-level only now, with its own guard. The
  old walk also miscounted 416 `vercel-plugin/skill-injections.jsonl` files
  as phantom zero-token sessions; those are excluded too.
- `model_breakdown` had no day filter, and the bar renders it on its "Today"
  row (`native/Bar.swift`) — the window walk turned a bounded error into "the
  week's model mix wearing a Today label" (the adversarial gate's find, real
  data: 121 sessions today, 268 badges). It now counts today's bucket only.

Validation: `.claude/output/20260717-r1-validation/report.md` (ISSUES-FOUND →
both MAJORs fixed same day; 8 guards in run-tests.sh § "aggregate window",
each watched red first and mutation-tested individually). Accepted-by-design
residue, documented in the code: a same-size rewrite forged to the same mtime
serves the stale cached summary (the make/rsync tradeoff — transcripts only
append), and a `.jsonl` directly in the projects root is not scanned (none
exists; Claude Code always creates a project dir).

## R2 — `seq` is positional but the client treats it as identity — DONE 2026-07-17

Designed then shipped per `docs/20260717-r2-stable-record-identity.md` (read it
for the identity table and the honest limits). Every record now carries `id`
alongside `seq`: line uuids for user/assistant/hook records, the first
member's `toolu_*` id for tool groups, an anchored-ordinal scheme for
mode-change events (their real lines carry no uuid AND no timestamp — the
first cut collided on live data as `mode::auto`). `/data` gained an
`after_id` cursor (unknown id → full set + `meta.cursor_reset`); the client
merges, cursors, and keys expansion state by id; `data-seq` and `#r<seq>`
anchors deliberately stay positional. Ids originate in untrusted transcript
bytes, so every id-bearing DOM attribute goes through `esc()`.

The adversarial gate (report:
`.claude/output/20260717-r2-validation/report.md`) confirmed ids unique across
418 real transcripts / 103,933 records and found two MAJORs, both closed:

- **Grow-and-close gap** (pre-existing, also in the old `since` path): a tools
  group that gains tools AND closes between two polls fell out of both the
  open-resend and after-cursor buckets — growth lost forever. Fix: the client
  cursor never parks ON an open group (`lastClosedId`), so an open group keeps
  being fetched until seen closed. Probe scenario pins it.
- **Mode-ordinal reassignment** under a mid-run rewrite re-renders shifted
  flips once (no data loss, unreachable today) — resolved as a documented
  honest limit; position-free identity for identical repeated events is
  impossible in principle.

`since-probe.py` is the executable spec of the whole contract: 15 checks, each
watched red first. Note for R3.6: `transcript.py --since` still lacks the
`open`-resend treatment, unchanged by R2 as designed.

## R3 — Small and known — DONE 2026-07-17

All seven shipped, each guard watched red first; gate verdict PASS-WITH-NOTES
(findings: `.claude/output/20260717-r3-validation/findings.md`). Notes acted
on: the `estimate_cost` call in `get_session_history` now passes `or 0`
explicitly instead of relying on the unpriced-model check firing before
`math.isfinite(None)` could crash, and the gate's behavioral cache probe was
promoted into the suite (`tests/fixtures/hub-cache-probe.py`) — it catches the
in-place-mutation regression a string grep cannot. R3.7 shipped as the cheap
version (tpath mtime vs the already-primed process age, 120s slack; statusline
rewrites tpath per render, so a false rejection needs a pointer a full
lifetime stale). Known residue from validation: the live hub's log history
moved to an unlinked inode (its pidfile was briefly deleted and restored
during a race test); resolves at the next natural hub restart. The original
table follows for provenance.

| # | what | where | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| R3.1 | `hub.sh` reports success when the **loopback co-bind** fails, printing a dead "this Mac" URL. The primary-port collision path is correct and tested; this is the *secondary* 127.0.0.1 bind failing while the tailnet bind succeeded. | `lib/hub.sh` start check + `lib/hub-server.py` (the co-bind block) | Verify the printed URL actually answers before claiming success |
| R3.2 | `PID_FILE` is not port-scoped → `CLAUDE_HUB_PORT=X hub.sh start` says "already running" about a hub on another port, and prints a dead URL for X. | `lib/hub.sh:20-21` | `/tmp/claude-hub-${PORT}.pid` (and the log). Check nothing else reads the old fixed path first. |
| R3.3 | `/data` re-parses the entire transcript on **every poll**, uncached, while being the incremental live-tail. Largest transcript on disk: 56MB. | `lib/hub-server.py` `_serve_data` | Cache keyed by `(path, mtime, size)` like R1's; they may share one helper |
| R3.4 | `read_tab_title` does an uncached full `os.listdir('/tmp')` **per live instance**, and again per event. | `lib/scan.sh` | Prime once per scan like `prime_process_info` does |
| R3.5 | `codex_parse_session` reports `tokens_in/out: 0` where the data is genuinely unavailable — reads as "used nothing" rather than "unknown". `cost_usd` is already `None` for codex. | `lib/scan.sh` | Verified: the codex format carries no usage keys at all. Making it `None` needs the aggregate sum (`or 0`) and `kfmt` to tolerate null, same shape as the cost fix |
| R3.6 | `transcript.py`'s own `--since` CLI flag lacks the `or r.get("open")` treatment that `/data` has. | `lib/transcript.py` main() | Dormant — nothing in the tree calls it. A latent trap for whoever reaches for the documented flag expecting parity |
| R3.7 | `read_transcript_path` trusts a stale tpath (PID reuse). Defense-in-depth only: **0 orphans** on this machine, the daemon reaps. | `lib/scan.sh` | Cheap guard if wanted: compare the tpath file's mtime against the process start (`ps -o lstart=`). Costs a subprocess per pid per scan — probably not worth it; batch it into `prime_process_info` if you do |

## How to work on these

The pattern that produced every real finding this session: **run it, don't read
it.** Every intuition lost to a measurement — "add a truncated flag" died at a
99% undercount, "parsing everything is too slow" died at +14ms, "the 26MB read
is the bottleneck" died at 17ms of 2835ms.

And **watch each guard fail before trusting it**. Every test added here was
mutation-tested: break the thing it protects on a `/tmp` copy, confirm the test
goes red, restore by copy. A guard nobody has seen fail is decoration.
